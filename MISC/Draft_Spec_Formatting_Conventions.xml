    <abstract>
      <t>This draft provides guidelines on formatting draft specifications
      for submission to the 0x10c standards committee.  It is designed
      to loosely correlate with the formatting of RFCs.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Currently there are no standards defined for the formatting
      of standards to the committee.  This RFC proposes using the
      standards already in place in RFCs globally.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    
    <section anchor="numbering" title="Numbering RFCs">
      <t>The numbering prefix of RFCs submitted to the 0x10c
      standards committee begins at X1000, as these
      RFCs are independent of the globally recognised list of RFCs.
      Hence this document forms RFC X1000.</t>
      <t>RFCs do not have a number assigned to them when they are
      initially submitted as drafts.  Only once an RFC is voted to
      be standard by the committee is it assigned the number, whichever
      the next freely available number is in the numbering sequence.</t>

    <section anchor="referencing" title="Referencing RFCs">
      <t>This is an example of how you would change the DOCTYPE if
      you wanted to reference RFC X1000 in your own XRFC.</t>

    <section anchor="formatting" title="Formatting">
      <t>Authors of RFCs for submission to the 0x10c standards
      committee are RECOMMENDED to use xml2ref as specified in <xref
      target="RFC2629">RFC 2629</xref> for initially drafting
      specifications they wish to submit.</t>
      <t>When authors want to submit their RFC they MUST include
      both the original source file if applicable (such as the
      .xml file if using xml2rfc) and a resulting plain text
      document that MUST formatted according to RFC conventions.</t>
      <t>The website <eref target="http://xml.resource.org/">
      http://xml.resource.org/</eref> is noted
      to have an online formatter than can perform this conversion
      for authors.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="authors" title="Author Notation">
      <t>Authors of RFCs MUST include their email address as part
      of their author status in an RFC.</t>
      <t>Authors of RFCs MAY include an URI that is unique to them.</t>
      <t>Inclusion of other information is OPTIONAL.</t>

    <section anchor="required-sections" title="Required Sections">
      <t>Authors of RFCs MUST provide a section for security
      considerations as specified in <xref target="RFC3552">RFC

    <section anchor="additional-notes" title="Additional Notes">
      <t>It is RECOMMENDED to authors of RFCs to look at the source
      file of this RFCs to gain a guideline on how RFCs are
      constructed with xml2rfc.</t>

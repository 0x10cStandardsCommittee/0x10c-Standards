                  Specification Formatting Conventions

Abstract

   This draft provides guidelines on formatting draft specifications for
   submission to the 0x10c standards committee.  It is designed to
   loosely correlate with the formatting of RFCs.

1.  Introduction

   Currently there are no standards defined for the formatting of
   standards to the committee.  This RFC proposes using the standards
   already in place in RFCs globally.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Numbering RFCs

   The numbering prefix of RFCs submitted to the 0x10c standards
   committee begins at X1000, as these RFCs are independent of the
   globally recognised list of RFCs.  Hence this document forms RFC
   X1000.

   For the purposes of strict number values (such as the number field


3.  Referencing RFCs

   This is an example of how you would change the DOCTYPE if you wanted
   to reference RFC X1000 in your own XRFC.

   <!DOCTYPE rfc SYSTEM "rfc2629.dtd" [ <!ENTITY rfcx1000 SYSTEM "https:
   //raw.github.com/hach-que/0x10c-Standards/master/MISC/
   Draft_Spec_Formatting_Conventions.xml"> ]>

   Then in the references section, do:

   &rfcx1000;


4.  Formatting

   Authors of RFCs for submission to the 0x10c standards committee are
   RECOMMENDED to use xml2ref as specified in RFC 2629 [RFC2629] for
   initially drafting specifications they wish to submit.

   When authors want to submit their RFC they MUST include both the
   original source file if applicable (such as the .xml file if using
   xml2rfc) and a resulting plain text document that MUST formatted
   according to RFC conventions.

                        Specification Conventions             April 2012


   The website http://xml.resource.org/ is noted to have an online
   formatter than can perform this conversion for authors.


5.  Author Notation

   Authors of RFCs MUST include their email address as part of their
   author status in an RFC.

   Authors of RFCs MAY include an URI that is unique to them.

   Inclusion of other information is OPTIONAL.


6.  Required Sections

   Authors of RFCs MUST provide a section for security considerations as
   specified in RFC 3552 [RFC3552].


7.  Additional Notes

   It is RECOMMENDED to authors of RFCs to look at the source file of
   this RFCs to gain a guideline on how RFCs are constructed with
   xml2rfc.


8.  Security Considerations

   This memo has no applicable security considerations.

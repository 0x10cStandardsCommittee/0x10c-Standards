1.  Introduction

   Shared Libraries depend on certain formats being given.  Strings,
   being a common argument type for cross-library calls, should
   therefore be standardized.  Length-prefixed strings are to be used
   for security and efficiency reasons.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Used Terms

   word
      16 bits.  This is the smallest unit addressable by the DCPU.

   character
      A group of bits representing a glyph or control sequence.  A
      control sequence is a non-printing character that influences the
      text.

   string
      A sequence of characters.  The length of the sequence can vary at
      runtime.

   P-string
      A string whose length in words is indicated by prefixing a word
      containing that length to the character string.  The prefix word
      itself MUST NOT be included when determining the length.

   C-string
      A string whose length is indicated by suffixing a NUL character to
      the character string.  The first occurrence of such NUL character
      terminates the string.  The NUL character is the character whose
      bits are all zero.

   library
      A group of functions used by different programs.

   program
      A sequence of machine instructions for the DCPU.

   user
      Any person using or creating a program.

2.  Structure of P-Strings

   A P-string is composed of a 16-bit length prefix and a sequence of n
   characters where n is the value of the prefix.

   P-string = n (nCHAR)

   The prefix for such a string MUST be present and MUST represent the
   exact number of following characters.


3.  Rationale for using P-Strings

3.1.  Benefits of P-Strings

   The rationale for using P-strings is a simple matter of weighing
   benefits against disadvantages.  Note that this is not a normative
   rationale, but one developed by the Standards Committee with focus on
   the DCPU design.

   o  Accessing the length of the string is O(1) fast.

   o  Buffer overflows are prevented by being able to allocate enough
      space ahead of time.

      *  This also increases the security of programs by preventing
         arbitrary shell code from being executed.

   o  The null-character can be used in strings, while using it in a
      C-string would terminate the string.

   o  The runtime cost of P-string concatenation is O(n), while the
      runtime cost of C-string concatenation is O(n+m).

3.2.  Disadvantages of P-Strings

   o  Indexing begins at 1 instead of 0.

   o  Fixed-length strings still require a prefixed length word.


4.  Other Notes

   o  Since the smallest addressable size in the DCPU is a word (16
      bits), this effectively allows a maximum string length of 65536
      characters without any loss in efficiency.

                              String Format                   April 2012


   o  Cutting off the beginning of a string is more expensive for
      P-strings, but cutting off the end is more expensive for
      C-strings.  (Other solutions are possible, but introduce memory
      leaks.)  Therefore, the two arguments negate each other.

   o  The names P-string and C-string come from Pascal and C, which use
      the respective format.


5.  Packed P-Strings

   The current implementation of characters in the DCPU effectively
   leaves the high 8 bits empty.  It is therefore possible to store two
   characters in one word.  Such packed strings are outside the scope of
   this RFC.


6.  Security Considerations

   Using P-strings reduces the risk of arbitrary shell code being
   executed by overflowing the input buffer.  However, hidden
   instructions in the string may be executed later when the sections
   are not cleared and the stack or instruction pointer is moved there.
   Measures should be taken by the user to ensure this does not happen.

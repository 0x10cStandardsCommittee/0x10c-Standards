                              String Format                   April 2012


1.  Introduction

   Shared Libraries depend on certain formats being given.  Strings,
   being a common argument type for cross-library calls, should
   therefore be standardized.  Length-prefixed strings are to be used
   for security and efficiency reasons.

1.1.  Terminology

   word
      16 bits.  This is the smallest unit addressable by the DCPU.

   character
      A group of bits representing a glyph or control sequence.  A
      control sequence is a non-printing character that influences the
      text.

   string
      A sequence of characters.  The length of the sequence can vary at
      runtime.

   P-string
      A string whose length in words is indicated by prefixing a word
      containing that length to the character string.  The prefix word
      itself MUST NOT be included when determining the length.

   C-string
      A string whose length is indicated by suffixing a NUL character to
      the character string.  The first occurrence of such NUL character
      terminates the string.  The NUL character is the character whose
      bits are all zero.

   library
      A group of functions used by different programs.

   program
      A sequence of machine instructions for the DCPU.

   user
      Any person using or creating a program.

1.2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Format

   A P-string is composed of a 16-bit length prefix and a sequence of n
   words where n is the value of the prefix.

   The prefix word MUST be present and MUST represent the exact number
   of following words.

   Note that the empty P-string consists entirely of a length word
   containing 0x0000.


     P-STRING  =  LENGTH BODY
     LENGTH    =  n
     BODY      =  nWORD
     WORD      =  %x0000-ffff
                       ; any 16-bit value



3.  Rationale

   This section is not normative.

   The rationale for using P-strings is a simple matter of weighing
   benefits against disadvantages.

3.1.  Benefits

   o  Accessing the length of the string is O(1) fast.

   o  Buffer overflows are prevented by being able to allocate enough
      space ahead of time.

      *  This also increases the security of programs by preventing
         arbitrary shell code from being executed.

   o  The null-character can be used in strings, while using it in a
      C-string would terminate the string.

   o  The runtime cost of P-string concatenation is O(n), while the
      runtime cost of C-string concatenation is O(n+m).

3.2.  Disadvantages

   o  Indexing begins at 1 instead of 0.

                              String Format                   April 2012


   o  Fixed-length strings still require a prefixed length word.  The
      same would be true of fixed-length C-strings.  Both formats can be
      abbreviated by omitting the known prefix/terminator at the cost of
      ceasing to be a P- or C-string per the definitions given here.


4.  Other Notes

   o  Since the smallest addressable size in the DCPU is a word (16
      bits), this effectively allows a maximum string length of 65536
      characters without any loss in efficiency.

   o  Cutting off the beginning of a string is more expensive for
      P-strings, but cutting off the end is more expensive for
      C-strings.  (Other solutions are possible, but introduce memory
      leaks.)  Therefore, the two arguments negate each other.

   o  The names P-string and C-string come from Pascal and C, which use
      the respective format.

   o  The current implementation of characters in the DCPU effectively
      leaves the high 8 bits empty.  It is therefore possible to store
      two characters in one word.  Such packed strings are outside the
      scope of this RFC.


5.  Security Considerations

   Using P-strings reduces the risk of arbitrary shell code being
   executed by overflowing the input buffer.  However, hidden
   instructions in the string may be executed later when the sections
   are not cleared and the stack or instruction pointer is moved there.
   Measures should be taken by the user to ensure this does not happen.

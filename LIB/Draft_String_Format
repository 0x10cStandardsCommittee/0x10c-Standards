                              String Format                   April 2012


1.  Introduction

   Shared Libraries depend on certain formats being given.  Strings,
   being a common argument type for cross-library calls, should
   therefore be standardized.  Length-prefixed strings are to be used
   for security and efficency reasons.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Used Terms

   o  "String" or "string" refers to a sequence of characters of
      variable length.

   o  "P-String", "pstring" or "length-prefixed string" refers to a
      8-bit value representing the length of the following string,
      followed by n characters of length n, where n is the value of the
      length-prefix.

   o  "C-String", "cstring" or "null-terminated string" refers to a
      sequence of characters that may not include the character with the
      value 0, followed by the character with value 0 (also known as
      "null-terminator" or "null character")

   o  "Character" or "character" refers to a group of 16 bits
      representing a letter, a number, a punctuation mark, or a control
      character.  A control character is a non-printable character that
      influences the text.

   o  "Library" or "library" refers to a group of functions that are
      used across different programs.

   o  "Program" or "program" refers to a sequence of machine
      instructions for the DCPU.

   o  "User" or "user" refers to any person using or creating a program.


2.  Structure of P-Strings

   A P-String is composed of a 8-bit length prefix and a sequence of n
   characters where n is the value of the prefix.

                              String Format                   April 2012


   An example for the string "Hello, World" would be

      | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |10 |11 |12 | Character
    0 |1 2|3 4|5 6|7 8|9 0|1 2|3 4|5 6|7 8|9 0|1 2|3 4| Byte
   +--+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |12| H | e | l | l | o | , |   | W | o | r | l | d | Data
   +--+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 1

   The prefix for such a string MUST be present and MUST represent the
   exact number of following characters.


3.  Benefits of P-Strings

   o  Accessing the length of the string is O(1) fast.

   o  Buffer overflows are prevented by being able to allocate enough
      space ahead of time.

      *  This also increases the security of programs by preventing
         arbitrary shell code from being executed.

   o  The null-character can be used in strings, while using it in
      C-Strings would terminate the string.

   o  The runtime cost of P-String concatenation is O(n), while the
      runtime cost of C-String concatenation is O(n+m).


4.  Disadvantages of P-Strings

   o  Instead of the conventional 0, indexing begins at 1.

   o  Even for fixed-length fields, the first byte would be needed for
      the length.


5.  Other Notes

   o  Since characters in the DCPU are one word (16 bit) wide, the
      length prefix should indicate the number of following characters,
      not the number of following bytes.  This would mean a limit of 512
      characters for a string, which is a reasonable restriction for the
      DCPU.

   o  Cutting off the beginning of a string is more expensive for
      P-Strings, but cutting off the end is more expensive for C-Strings
      (other solutions are possible, but introduce memory leaks).
      Therefore, those two arguments negate each other.


6.  Security Considerations

   Using P-Strings reduces the risk of arbitrary shell code being
   executed by overflowing the input buffer.  However, hidden
   instructions in the string may be executed later when the sections
   are not cleared and the stack or instruction pointer is moved there.
   Measurements should be taken by the user to assure that this does not
   happen.

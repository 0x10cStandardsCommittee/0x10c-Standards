                       Standardized Math Library

Abstract

   This draft is being purposed to provide basic math functions that
   should be present in all machines, along with very arbitrary calling
   names that should never interfere with programs already on the
   machine.

1.  Introduction and Purpose

   The purposing of this document to the 0x10c standards commitee is to
   make the proposal for a standard math library, which if the authors
   of vital utilites such as compilers and assemblers make a
   standardized library in the future, a math library such as this would
   be nessacary.  Usage of these standardized implmentations of the math
   functions would also have the advantage of being equally accurate.
   Two machines would receive the same result for a Sine function.

   The author of this draft has worked on a library for such this
   purpose and would like to recomend it to the commitee as the library
   of choice for the topic of this document.  The author recomends
   FooMath (https://github.com/MatthewEdgmon/FooMath).


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted and understood as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Features

   FooMath contains functions for working with 16 to 64 bit integers.
   It includes Sine, Cosine, Tangenent, Exponents, Square Roots, and
   basic math routines.  However usage of the basic math routines for
   16-bits acts only as a reference-wrapper function and should not be
   used.


4.  Advantages

   The advantages of adopting a standardized arithmetics library now far
   outweigh the cons.  If adopted, then mathematics heavy applications
   (such as those for finding distance between you and a rock mine for
   example) have a common ground in their calculating.  If the focus of
   optimizing was spent only on this one library, the amount of time
   spent on individual apllications optimizing and debugging can be kept
   to a minimum.  Another advantage is that creating a standard library
   like in C/C++ would have a big task of rewritting all of the math
   functions.  Creating and editing one now would decrease the load work
   on creating one later, when such a proposal is already underway.

5.  Disadvantages

   There are no disadvantages.  Time spent working on the library by the
   author serves only as a minor inconvience at best.


6.  Standardized Usage

   Usage of the library as a source file for use in programs for the
   DCPU-16 should be made to follow these guidelines.  The first
   guideline is to only use the first callable label of a function.
   Dissecting the source and looking for mid-function labels to jump to
   is prohibited and invalidates the standardized usage.

   All functions of the library return in A, per commitee standards, and
   all functions save working registers before executing.  If any parts
   of the library are found to be incompatable with the commitee's ABI,
   please alert the author.


7.  Additional Notes

   If FooMath is not a desired choice by the commitee, the author asks
   it be put on temporarily, and then edited/replaced with a more
   desired one for whatever reason.


8.  Security Considerations

   This memo has no applicable security considerations.

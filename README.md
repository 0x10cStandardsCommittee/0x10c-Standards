# 0x10c Standards Committee #

The 0x10c Standards Committee is a fully community driven organization working towards a series of standards for application development for the DCPU-16 within 0x10c.

## Directory Hierarchy ##

### ABI ###
This directory contains the standards and proposals regarding the Application Binary Interface.

### ASM ###
If you want to write DCPU-16 assembly (probably the case), this is where to look. It contains standards about the syntax and has information for assemblers and compilers.

### FS ###
This directory contains the standards and proposals regarding the File System(s) used by the DCPU-16.

### LIB ###
In here go all specifications and proposals for the layout and implementation of libraries.

### NET ###
Anything about networking goes in the net folder.

### MISC ###
In this directory goes everything that does not fit in the other directories defined above.


## Procedures and Naming Standards ##

If you have a proposal, idea or comment regarding upcoming or new standards, you can make an issue about it.

From these issues, a Draft will be created using Pull Requests. The draft will be named Draft\_\<Subject\>\_\<UID\>.txt, where the uid is an unsigned integer starting at 1.

When the community agrees on the draft being a standard, and the game is expected to not collide with the standard in a later stage, the draft will be renamed Standard_\<Subject\>.md.


## Community ##

With pull requests you can propose changes to drafts or create new drafts.

The issues section should be used to comment on the documents and to suggest changes to make them better.

Everything that is not directly about the standards should go to  
[#0x10c-dev](irc://irc.freenode.net/#0x10c-dev) @ FreeNode.net

You can discuss the ideas, drafts and standards via IRC:  
[#0x10c-std](irc://irc.freenode.net/#0x10c-std) @ FreeNode.net

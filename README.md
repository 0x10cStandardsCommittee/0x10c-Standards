# 0x10c Standards Committee #

The 0x10c Standards Committee is a fully community driven organization working towards a series of standards for application development for the DCPU-16 within 0x10c.

## Directory Hierarchy ##

### ABI ###
This directory contains the standards and proposals regarding the Application Binary Interface.

### ASM ###
If you want to write DCPU-16 assembly (probably the case), this is where to look. It contains standards about the syntax and has information for assemblers and compilers.

### FS ###
This directory contains the standards and proposals regarding the File System(s) used by the DCPU-16.

### LIB ###
In here go all specifications and proposals for the layout and implementation of libraries.

### NET ###
Anything about networking goes in the net folder.

### MISC ###
In this directory goes everything that does not fit in the other directories defined above.


## Naming Standards ##

Proposals for new standards must be named Proposal_<Subject>_<UID>.txt, where UID is a number starting by 1, incremented by 1 for each new proposal.
Updates for a proposal should be submitted via updates to the file, not with a new file.

Standards are named Standard_<Subject>.md and should adhere the [markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) 


## Community ##

With pull requests you can propose changes to drafts or create new drafts.

The issues section should be used to comment on the documents and to suggest changes to make them better.

Everything that is not directly about the standards should go to  
[#0x10c-dev](irc://irc.freenode.net/#0x10c-dev) @ FreeNode.net

You can discuss the ideas, drafts and standards via IRC:  
[#0x10c-std](irc://irc.freenode.net/#0x10c-std) @ FreeNode.net

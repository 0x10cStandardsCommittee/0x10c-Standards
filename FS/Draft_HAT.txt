HAT - Harry's Allocation Table
=========================
Version 1.0

HAT is a file system designed to be used on the DCPU-16 in 0x10c.

This refers to the datastructure of the filesystem.
It should be possible to implement HAT using only the structure as a reference.

Note: The major version only changes when compatibility is broken.

Data structure on disk
----------------------
All sizes are given in words (16 bits)

### header - 16 words ###
    +------+-------------+
    | Size |    Name     |
    +------+-------------+
    |    1 | version     | 
    |    1 | flags       |
    |    1 | num_inodes  |
    |    1 | num_blocks  |
    |    2 | block_start |
    |    2 | inode_start |
    |    1 | block_size  |
    |    7 | padding     |
    +------+-------------+

 * version is split into 2 bytes. The first byte is the magic number 0x40, which is the chosen magic number for HAT. The second byte is the major version of HAT.
 * flags contains flags pertaining to the state of the filesystem
 * num_inodes is the number of inodes in the filesystem
 * num_blocks is the number of data blocks in the filesystem
 * inode_start is the absolute position on the disk of the first inode
 * block_start is absolute position on the disk of the first block
 * block_size is the total size of the data block structure in words. block_size must be a power of two
 * padding is to make the header 16 words long to make sure that the first inode is aligned nicely
 

### header flags ###
    +-------+---------------+
    |  Bit  |      Name     |
    +-------+---------------+
    |     0 | is_mounted    |
    | 1->15 | reserved      |
    +-----+-----------------+
Bit 0 is the LSB, Bit 15 is the MSB

 * is_mounted is used to check whether HAT was cleanly unmounted. While mounted it must be set to 1, when unmounted it must be set to 0

### inode - 32 words ###
    +------+--------------+
    | Size |     Name     |
    +------+--------------+
    |    1 | flags        |
    |    1 | parent_inode |
    |    2 | file_size    |
    |    1 | block_index  |
    |   27 | file_name    |
    +------+--------------+
inodes are stored contiguously, the first inode has an index of 0 and is the root directory

 * flags contains all the bit flags for the inode
 * parent_inode is the inode of the directory this file is stored in
 * file_size is the length of the file in words
 * block_index is the index of the first block of the file
 * file_name is a null terminated string, only alphanumeric characters, periods(.) and underscores(_) are allowed. The maximum filename length is 26 characters

### inode flags ###
    +-------+---------------+
    |  Bit  |      Name     |
    +-------+---------------+
    |     0 | file_exists   |
    |     1 | is_directory  |
    |     2 | is_executable |
    |     3 | is_writable   |
    | 4->15 | reserved      |
    +-----+-----------------+
Bit 0 is the LSB, Bit 15 is the MSB

 * file_exists is 0 when the inode isn't in use, 1 when the inode refers to a file
 * is_directory is 0 when the inode is for a file, 1 when the inode is for a directory
 * is_writable is 0 when the inode is not read-only, 1 when modifiable. When read-only the only change that can be made to the inode is to disable the is_writable flag.


### data block - block_size words ###
    +---------------+------------------+
    |      Size     | Name             |
    +---------------+------------------+
    |           1   | next_block_index |
    |  block_size-1 | raw_data         |
    +---------------+------------------+
data blocks are stored contiguously, the first block has an index of 0

 * next_block_index is the index of the next block of file data
 * raw_data is the raw file data
